Book-taste clustering in goodreads communities
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repo has been created in the context of a study project in module ``CS5232 Social And Digital Media Analytics`` at the National University of Singapore.


This project aims to detect and study Goodreads communities based on the book ratings given
by users. Through this analysis we seek to understand whether the communities detected based on
similar book tastes are alike to the friends communities formed by users themselves on Goodreads
and the extent to which these user communities on goodreads exhibit homophily.
