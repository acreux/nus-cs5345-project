Study project for class CS5232 Social And Digital Media Analytics at National University of Singapore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our project aims to detect and study Goodreads communities based on the book ratings given
by users. Through this analysis we seek to understand whether the communities detected based on
similar book tastes are alike to the friends communities formed by users themselves on Goodreads
and the extent to which these user communities on goodreads exhibit homophily.
